### Project Overview
---
The report gives an analysis of Sales Data, using pivot tables and some Excel formulas like SUMIF, AVERAGEIF, MAX, MIN to give key insights. Some of the insights are: Total Sales by Product, Total Sales by Region, Total Sales by Month etc. SQL was also use to derive insights and PowerBI was used for the visualization.


### Data Source 
---
The Primary Source of Data used is SalesData.csv and CustomerData.csv which was downloaded from LITA Class LMS page (Canvas).

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [View Here](https://1drv.ms/x/c/96d72dbaef9f7a90/Eab1VlHPNP9DuSr3XG7bF3IBPwgnXOxY2mxgcWPM3F_yaA)
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Query Data
- PowerBI - For Visualization

### MICROSOFT EXCEL

- Data Exploration
- Data Analysis

### Data Exploration for Excel
---
I went through the data set to make sure there are no missing values or duplicated values.

### Data Analysis for Excel 
---
Some Excel formulars are used to calculated some values and Pivot Table for summarizing the SaleData. All these were carried out under the following: 

#### Total Sales by Product 
The Total Sales by Product summary reveals that the total sales for Shoes for the two years is **3,087,500**, total sales for Shirt is **2,450,000**, total sales for Hat is **1,587,000**, total sales for Gloves is **1,500,000**, total sales for Jacket is **1,050,000**, total sales for Socks is **912,500** which gives the Grand Total of **10,587,500**.
This helps to identify product with the highest sales which in this case is Shoes **3,087,500** and the product that has the lowest sales Socks **912,500**.

#### Total Sales by Region
In the sales dataset there are four region, the pivot table summarize total sales providing insights on the following:
- Region with the Highest Sales which is South with the total sales of **4,675,000**.
- Region with the Lowest Sales which is West with the Total Sales of **1,512,500**. 

#### Total Sales by Month
This summary is aim at looking at the month with the lowest sales which is December with **250,000** total sales. This summary can help to carry out investigation on why it has the lowest sales and find solution on what can be done to improve sales for the month.

#### Average Sales by Product
With the use of Excel Formula AVERAGEIF, I calculated the average sales of each products.

![AverageIf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c81d973-7f4a-4435-8e86-6d72f4432ba3)

#### Total Revenue by Region
The Excel Formula SUMIF helps to calculate the total revenue generated by each region which inturn shows which region need more focus or which one needs more additional sales effort/marketing.

### STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE
---
- Creating Database
- Data Loading 
- Querying of Data to gain insights  

### Creating Database in SQL
---
The first step I took was to create the Database for my project on SQL Server which I named LITA_Capstone_Project.

### Data Loading in SQL
---
I converted my SalesData Excel Worksheet into Comma Seperted Values (CSV) file format, then I load my Sales Data into my database for analysis.

### Querying of Data to gain insights in SQL
---
After loading the Sales Data into my database, I began to write my queries to derive insights into the Dataset. With the use of SQL queries, I was able to extract some key insights from the Sale Data. The key insights includes:

#### Total Sales for each Product Category
---
```SQL
SELECT [Product_Category], SUM([Sales_Amount]) AS Total_Sales
FROM [dbo].[LITA Capstone Dataset]
GROUP BY [Product_Category]
ORDER BY [Total_Sales] DESC;
```
**Result**

### POWERBI
---
- Data Loading
- Data Visualization

### Data Loading in PowerBI
---
The first thing I did on my PowerBI was to load the SalesData Excel Workbook and then check my Column Distribution, Column Profile and Column Quality to make sure my data is clean.

### Data Visualization in PowerBI
---
Using all the key insights I have gotten from my Microsoft Excel and SQL I then use PowerBI to build my visualization.

### Conclusion
---
The dashboard give insight to the Total Sales amount of **10,587,500**, the Average Sales of **211.75** using *Measure* to calculate it. With the use of card the total number of customers in the dataset was counted using the *Distinct Count* so it will not count the same CustomerID twice. Also, the Pie Chart shows the percentage of Total Sales by Region where *South* have **44.16%**, *East* - **23.14%**, *North* - **18.42%** and *West* - **14.29%**. The Line Chart shows the Sales Trend from 2023 to 2024 which indicate 2024 sales is lower compare to 2023 sales. We have customer *Cus1488*, *Cus1375*, *Cus1023*, *Cus1059* and *Cus1367* as the Top 5 Customer by Sales. The matrix gives insight to the Top Selling Product *Shoe* with the total sales of **3,087,500**, this also shows clearly in the Bar Chart as Shoes is the highest in the chat. Total Sales of 2024 was represented with column chat based on monthly sales. Finally, slicers for *Product*, *Quarter*, and *Region*  was used to allow user to filter the SalesData easily. All these insights will help to make informed decision that can increase sales and revenue.

## PROJECT 2: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION FOR A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE


### Project Overview for Project 2
---
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. The goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard that presents the analysis.

### MICROSOFT EXCEL

### Data Exploration for Excel
---
I went through the data set to make sure there are no missing values or duplicated values.

### Data Analysis for Excel Customer Data
---
Some Excel formulars are used to calculated some values and Pivot Table for summarizing the CustomerData. The following insights are derived from the dataset; 

#### Subscription Pattern
The customer data shows the pattern of subscription which is Basic, Premeium and Standard. Count of CustomerID shows that **Basic Subcription** have **37,500** CustomerID, **Premium Subscription** have **18,750** CustomerID while **Standard Subscription** has **18,750** CustomerID. The **total count** of CustomerID is **75,000**.

![Subscription Pattern](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e42fcba-390f-4dc5-a3de-511b9357721b)

From the table we can see that **Basic** have the highest count of CustomerID while **Standard** have the lowest count of CustomerID among the SubscriptionType.

#### Average Subscription Duration
To find the Average Subscription Duration I substract the SubscriptionStart from the SubscriptionEnd to get the SubscriptionDuration. After which I use the **AVERAGEIF** function and Pivot Table to calculate the Average SubscriptionDuration. The findings shows that Average SubscriptionDuration for **Basic** is **365.3**, **Premium** is **365.4** and **Standaard** is **365.4**. 

![AverageDuration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1118aad-0874-4e67-abae-6f6f3d9068e1)

#### Revenue By Region
Here I gain insight on the region that bring in the highest Revenue by analyzing the data using the Region and Revenue column. I was able to derive that **South** with the total value **37,580,782** generate the highest revenue out of the four region. 

![Revenue by Region](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff77d05e-c829-4222-8d38-9334d4061102)

#### Most Popular SubscriptionType
*Basic* is the most popular subscription type as it is the subscription that have the highest *Revenue* **74,756,784** and also the highest Count of *CustomerID* **37,500**

![Most Popular Sub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9c2f46-1008-4fc9-a059-15791afb000b)

#### Subscription Cancelation and Renewal
Using the Canceled and Revenue column, the analysis shows that we have **82,346,223** renewal while we have **67,473,463** cancelation.

### Conclusion for Customer Data
---
The insights gained from the CustomerData includes: Total Revenue **149,819,686**, where *South* have **37,580,782**, *West* - **37,482,120**, *East* - **37,387,894** and *North* - ***37, 368,890**. Average Subscription Duraction **365.35**, with the use of *Measure*. By using the Count (Distinct) the total number of Customer was found to be **20** with each Region have the same number of customer **5** each. Based on the dataset *Active Subscriptions* are **41,250** and *Canceled Subscriptions* are **33,750**.  The Most Popular Subscription of them all is *Basic* **50%** of the Subscription while the other two subscription have **25%** each. North, South and West are the region with the most subscription cancellation. These insights will help to make informed decision and help to investigate why some region have higher subscription cancellation and what can be done to improve in the area.
